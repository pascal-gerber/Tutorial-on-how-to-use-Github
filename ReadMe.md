## How to use the web version of Github.

Firstly, let us look at what a github reposetory is.
Imagine that the reposetory is like a Folder of files and codes that you put online on the internet for everone to ACCESS.
Github allows you to do EXACTLY that.


And now, How do i make one?
making one is very easy over the web.
First, you start by making a github account "hope it doesn't require a Tutorial :b"
And once you have it, you must select the **Reposetories** and click **New**

You will see this site pop up.
this is the options of the reposetory.
TIP: Choose your reposetory name wisely, otherwise you'd have to remake it.
Recommandation: best you just add a title and a Description, the rest you can all add manually later easely.
