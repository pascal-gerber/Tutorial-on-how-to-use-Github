# How to use Github.

## How to use the web version of Github.

Firstly, let us look at what a github reposetory is.\
Imagine that the reposetory is like a Folder of files and codes that you put online on the internet for everone to ACCESS.\
Github allows you to do EXACTLY that.
\
\
And now, How do i make one?\
making one is very easy over the web.\
First, you start by making a github account "hope it doesn't require a Tutorial :b"\
And once you have it, you must select the **Repositories** and click **New**\

\
\
You will see this site pop up.\
this is the options of the repository.\
_TIP: Choose your reposetory name wisely, otherwise you'd have to remake it._\
**Recommandation: best you just add a title and a Description, the rest you can all add manually later easely.**\

Or you can upload using [the Command Line](https://github.com/pascal-gerber/Tutorial-on-how-to-use-Github/blob/main/CMD/Github%20CMD.md) "which is more hard but also has more specific benefits"\
### Way to download someones code easely trought web.
