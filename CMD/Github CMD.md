###### My recommandation
But i recommand to still keep on using the Normal CMD since its just better.\
With the normal CMD you can select any path by openning the path on your explorer,\
and write in the path "Cmd".

now the annoying part when creating a new reposetory.\
##############################################################################################################||\
copy here#######################################################################################################\\/
```
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/pascal-gerber/test.git
git push -u origin main
```
\
and once every link is established, you can simply use 3 simple commands\

```
git add *
git commit -m "new update"
git push
```
\
very simple\
Now up to some key knowledge for github.
# Github main commands for adding new files or/and modifiying your reposetory
```
git init
```
/\ will make a prepared settup for the upload in the specific reposetory\
the other mainly used codes will be stored in this file as settings.\

```
git add *
```
/\ the syntax can be changed by changing the star to a certain file\
this process is like the selecting of a file\

```
git commit -m "first commit"
```
/\ the commit works as a title setting\
you can make a title for each of your commits, like a name for a step forward\

```
git push
```
/\ you may, or may not have heard about it\
git push is simply for pasting the copied file into the cloud
