#### Links

[Click me](https://cli.github.com/) for the page itself\
[Click me](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.13.0/gh_2.13.0_windows_amd64.msi) for the Programm directly

#### Download

Don't be affraid of the download, you can simply "spam" the button since its supposed to be properly put in the settings of the download.\
There will be many pages

#### Execution

The Command Line of the app itself is found there.

###### My recommandation
But i recommand to still keep on using the Normal CMD since its just better.\
With the normal CMD you can select any path by openning the path on your explorer,\
and write in the path "Cmd".
